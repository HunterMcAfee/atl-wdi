### Post answers (and links to where you found them) for each of the questions below:

1. Can we use `npm` with React or do we have to use `yarn`?
It's up to the user's personal choice.  You can use either.

2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?
You are not required to use JSX with React.  Alternatives that are popular are community projects such as react-hyperscript and hyperscript-helpers.

3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?
Only if the component's state has been changed.

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component? No, because the prop is supposed to remain a 'pure' function.
